# Wormhole MyOTP
Wormhole MyOTP is an innovative security solution focused on enhancing the security and usability of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The platform utilizes cross-chain OTP (One-Time Password) verification and blockchain-integrated passkey systems to create a robust layer of security for mobile applications, particularly on Android. By integrating biosensors for user verification without storing personal data, we ensure privacy while maintaining high security standards.

## Features
- Cross-Chain OTP Verification: Securely generates and verifies OTPs across multiple blockchain networks.
- Blockchain Passkey System: Implements a secure passkey mechanism using blockchain technology.
- Biosensor Integration: Utilizes biosensors for user verification without storing biometric data.
- Fully Mobile: Developed for Android devices, offering secure and seamless access to DeFi applications.
- Bot Prevention: Protects against bot attacks using WorldCoin verification.

## Post-Hackathon Goals
- Enhance biosensor accuracy for more reliable user verification.
- Improve the user interface (UI) to optimize user experience.
- Expand cross-chain compatibility to support a broader range of blockchain networks.

## Usage
The repository contains scripts and components to generate and verify OTPs across different blockchain networks.
Use the Android app for secure authentication with the integrated passkey system and biometric verification.
